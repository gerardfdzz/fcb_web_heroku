# FcbWeb

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.4.

## Deploy
The [app is deployed](https://fcb-web-gerard-fernandez.herokuapp.com/) in heroku.

## Data
The [application deployed on heroku](https://heroku-hosting-json-server.herokuapp.com/team), obtains the data through a json-server deployed on heroku, simulating an API (fake).
In local, the data is obtained from the "fcb.json" file, inside this same project.

## App running
Type `npm run all-start` in the project console to start the 2 services (takes a few seconds), the json server (read "fcb.json" file) and the angular (run app).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
